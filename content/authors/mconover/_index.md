Mitch Conover is a manager at Janssen Research and Development, a Johnson & Johnson company. His interests include evaluating and developing methods for conducting causal inference research within imperfect secondary health databases. Before joining Janssen Research and Development, Mitch completed an MSPH, PhD and postdoctoral research position in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His dissertation explored the validity of using all-available historical data to characterize patient medical histories, as opposed to the more widely used approach of assessing only a uniform look-back period. In his postdoctoral work, he explored the implications of using various modeling approaches to estimate effects within study sub-groups, including propensity score methods, g-computation, and doubly-robust estimation, fit within sub-groups and in the full study cohort.
