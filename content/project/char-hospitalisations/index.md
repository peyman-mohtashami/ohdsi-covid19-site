title: "Characterizing individuals hospitalized with influenza in 2009-2010 and 2014-2019, and COVID-19 in 2019-2020"
summary: "We aimed to characterize the morbidity and demographic profile of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospitals in XXX different countries between Jan 1st, 2020 and XXX XXth, 2020. We assessed the frequency of “medical outcomes”, the treatments administered and the procedures that the patients underwent during hospitalization. Finally, we contextualized our study by reproducing its design in two cohorts of influenza patients admitted to hospitals in 2014-2019 and in 2009-2010 (Avian influenza season), identified in the same base populations."
